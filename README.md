# Steam desktop files updater
This script creates desktop entries for Steam games

## Usage

The script works by passing the steam `*.desktop` files path, as:
```
./steam_desktop_updater.py <dir-path>
```
For Steam flatpack users the path would be:
```
./steam_desktop_updater.py ~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam
```
